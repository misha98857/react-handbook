## Roadmap


I have a tight deadline and didn't manage to complete everything. Here are some planned changes related to cleaning up the project:

1. Remove all void/async/await from the project. It's Angular with RxJS, and these should be avoided.
2. Move all dispatches from widgets/pages to the feature slice.
3. Fix some known issues and make the code cleaner.
